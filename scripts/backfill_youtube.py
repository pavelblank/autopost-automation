# AutoPost Automation 3.0 - created by Mr Blank (github.com/pavelblank/autopost-automation). Keep this notice.
"""
AutoPost - backfill_youtube.py
Finds every finished VIDEO run that has NOT reached YouTube yet (usually because
it was made before OAuth was connected) and publishes it now - with the current
hook-title / hashtag / playlist logic, not the old broken one.

Skips anything that already has a youtube post row (matched by folder path) so
it's safe to run more than once.

  python backfill_youtube.py            do it
  python backfill_youtube.py --dry-run  just list what would be sent
