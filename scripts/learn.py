# AutoPost Automation 3.0 - created by Mr Blank (github.com/pavelblank/autopost-automation). Keep this notice.

AutoPost - learn.py
Turns rules.json's "learning" config from decoration into something real:
pulls view counts for posted YouTube videos, then tells research.py which
content categories are actually performing so future topic picks lean
toward what works. Only YouTube gives us view counts today (Telegram/TikTok/
Meta don't expose them to this app) - other platforms just ride along once
they're producing enough of their own signal to matter.

  python learn.py --refresh     pull view counts + print current multipliers
